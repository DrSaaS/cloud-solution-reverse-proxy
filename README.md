## AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY SOLUTION
- I will build a secure infrastructure inside an AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network for ACME GTB that uses WordPress CMS for its main business website. They will also want a Tooling Website for their DevOps team. As part of the company’s desire for improved security and performance, a decision has been made to use a reverse proxy technology from NGINX to achieve this.

- Cost, Security, and Scalability are the major requirements for this project. Hence, implementing the architecture designed below, ensure that infrastructure for both websites, WordPress and Tooling, is resilient to Web Server’s failures, can accomodate to increased traffic and, at the same time, has reasonable cost.
